**Project description:** This project aims to understand the features that hit songs have in common. In particular, I was interested in knowing if a song’s artist, the genre of the song and, its other musical features like danceability, energy, loudness among others can help distinguish hit and non-hit songs. To achieve this, I trained a logitistic regression model and compared the results of this model with the non-parametric classification method, random forests. Since the logistic regression model is more interpretable, I have drawn inferences from it. From the model, it can inferred that the popularity of a song’s artist and the song genre does highly influence the odds of a song getting hit. Another influential music feature is danceability. Songs that are more danceable have higher odds of becoming hit.

### 1. Data Collection method

To do this analysis I collected data from the Spotify web-developer [API](https://developer.spotify.com/)

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
